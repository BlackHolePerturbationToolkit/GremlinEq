Gremlin is Teukolsky equation solver for a point particle on a bound, timelike orbit. GremlinEq is a version of Gremlin that specializes the source to circular and equatorial orbits of Kerr black holes. The full Gremlin package will be released publicly via the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit; certain proprietary libraries that were used in its development must be cleaned up and replaced with Open Source resources. GremlinEq has been so cleaned, and is hereby provided as an initial release. 

## Documentation
